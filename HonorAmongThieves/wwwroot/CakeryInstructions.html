        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        You are professional thief. Or at least, you're trying to be one. <br />
        <br />
        <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>
        The objective of this game is to make the most money from selling baked goods. <br />
        This is cumulative - your total score at the end is the sum of the money you earnt from selling your goods every round. <br />
        Your score is based off the total sales, not profit. <br />
        <br />
        <h3>MECHANICS</h3>
        Every round, you get to buy ingredients, or create them via other means. <br />
        Using these ingredients, you bake Cookies, Croissants, or Cakes. <br />
        At the end of every round, all your Cookies, Cakes, and Croissants are sold in the market. <br />
        In general, the more of one good is in the market, the less they will sell for. <br />
        The prices of each good will also fluctuate from round to round, and from one game to the next. <br />
