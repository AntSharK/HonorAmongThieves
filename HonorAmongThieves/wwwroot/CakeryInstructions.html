        This is cumulative - <b>your total score at the end is the sum of the money you earn from selling your goods every round.</b> <br />
        Your score is based off your total sales, not profit. <br />

        Every round, you get to buy ingredients, or create them via upgrades you own.
        Ingredients are used to bake Cookies, Croissants, or Cakes. <br />
        <b>Unused ingredients at the end of every round are refunded at a discount.</b> <br />
        <br /><h4>BAKING</h4>
        Using ingredients (or upgrades), you bake Cookies, Croissants, or Cakes.
        <b>At the end of every round, all baked goods are automatically sold.</b> <br />
        In general, the more of one good is in the market, the less they will sell for.
        The selling price of each good will also fluctuate from round to round. <br />
