        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        You've done it. At long last, you have opened your very own bakery. <br />
        But what's this? It appears that many other bakeries have opened right across the street. At the exact same time! <br />
        This cannot stand. You must be the greatest baker of all. <br />
        <br />
        <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>
        The objective of this game is to make the most money from selling baked goods. <br />
        This is cumulative - your total score at the end is the sum of the money you earn from selling your goods every round. <br />
        Your score is based off your total sales, not profit. <br />
        <br />
        <h3>MECHANICS</h3>
        <h4>UPGRADES</h4>
        You start the game with a certain amount of "Upgrade Credit". This can only be used for buying upgrades. <br />
        When you run out of "Upgrade Credit", you will use money to buy upgrades. <br />
        Upgrades purchased can only be used in the next round. <br />
        Some upgrades have a limited number of uses - purchase more to get more uses. <br />
        Some upgrades have an unlimited number of uses - purchase more to make them more efficient. <br />
        <h4>INGREDIENTS</h4>
        Every round, you get to buy ingredients, or create them via upgrades you own. <br />
        Ingredients are used to bake Cookies, Croissants, or Cakes. <br />
        Unused ingredients at the end of every round are refunded at a discount. <br />
        <h4>BAKING</h4>
        Using ingredients (or upgrades), you bake Cookies, Croissants, or Cakes. <br />
        At the end of every round, all your Cookies, Cakes, and Croissants are sold in the market. <br />
        In general, the more of one good is in the market, the less they will sell for. <br />
        The selling price of each good will also fluctuate from round to round. <br />
        <br />
        <h3>SETUP</h3>
        Each player starts with an 'Upgrade Credit'. This is an amount of money that can only be used for upgrading. <br />
        Each player gets an 'Annual Allowance' at the start of every year. <br />
