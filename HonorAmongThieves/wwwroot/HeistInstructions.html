        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        You are professional thief. Or at least, you're trying to be one. <br />
        You wouldn't be one if the job market wasn't this terrible. <br />
        Fortunately, your parents have granted you a sizable fortune to live off. <br />
        This fortune also paid for your 2 masters degrees in social work and fine art. Which might explain your job situation. <br />
        <br />
        <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>
        The objective of this game is to be the richest thief alive by the time you retire. <br />
        The game begins in 2018 and lasts an arbitrary number of years. At the end, everyone retires together. <br />
        The upper limit for the number of years the game lasts is set by the room creator. <br />
        The lower limit for the number of years the game lasts is half of the upper limit (rounded down). <br />
        <br />
        <h3>HEIST OCCURRENCE</h3>
        Every year, you will take part in a heist. <br />
        For everyone's security, your heist mates are chosen by an arbitrary third party. <br />
        Each heist consists of 2 or more thieves (including you). The upper bound is set by the room creator. <br />
        The reward for a heist increases the larger it is (i.e. more thieves equals more money per person). <br />
        In the lobby of every heist, you can see the amount of years each fellow thief has spent in jail, and their approximate networth. <br />
        Note that this is only a very rough estimate of their real networth, which only they know. <br />
        <br />
        <h3>GOING ON HEISTS</h3>
        You will be given a choice of whether or not to take part in the heist. <br />
        If half (rounded up) or more of the thieves in the heist choose to take part, the heist will occur. <br />
        The total reward is always the same. So the fewer thieves who take part, the larger the reward per thief. <br />
        If more than half of the thieves don't show up, the heist does not happen and no one earns anything for that year. <br />
        Regardless of whether the heist happens, all the thiefs that opt to take part will know of each other. <br />
        <br />
        <h3>SNITCHING</h3>
        You can also opt to snitch on the thieves in the same heist as you. <br />
        If you snitch on them, and the heist happens, then every single thief that went on the heist goes to jail, and you get reward money. <br />
        Snitching on a heist also means that the heist does not dish out any reward. <br />
        If you snitch on them, and the heist doesn't happen, you get put in jail for one year. <br />
        If multiple thieves snitch, the reward money is split between them. <br />
        Note that you can snitch on a heist you take part in. <br />
        Also note if you snitch on a heist, even if you don't go on it, you can still be killed! <br />
        <br />
        <h3>GOING TO JAIL</h3>
        If you are sent to jail because you took part in a heist, your next jail sentence will be twice as long. <br />
        If you are sent to jail because you snitched on a heist that did not happen, you will always be sentenced for only one year. Your sentence will not increase. <br />
        If you are sent to jail on a heist that you snitched on, you will receive the minimum sentence. But your next sentence will still increase. <br />
        <br />
        <h3>COMMITTING MURDER</h3>
        You can also opt to murder a thief in the same heist as you. <br />
        This option makes you go on the heist. <br />
        If the other thief does not show up for the heist and does not snitch, then you can't kill him. <br />
        In the event that the other thief has snitched on an earlier heist, or is snitching on the current heist, you kill him. <br />
        Killing another thief will give you his entire fortune and remove that thief from play. <br />
        However, if you try to kill a thief who has never snitched on a heist that occurred, the other thiefs protect him, and you die and lose the game. <br />
        If multiple players successfully kill a thief at the same time, his fortune is split evenly. <br />
        <br />
        <h3>SPECIAL CONDITIONS</h3>
        If only 1 thief is out of jail and alive, then no heists happen that year. <br />
        If everyone dies, then there is no winner and you should also stop hanging out with this group of people. <br />
        Killing happens before snitching. You can't snitch if you're dead. <br />
        If multiple people kill each other, the order of killing for the purposes of calculating networth is random. <br />
