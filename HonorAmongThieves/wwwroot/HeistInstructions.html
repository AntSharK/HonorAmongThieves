        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        You are professional thief. Or at least, you're trying to be one. <br />
        You wouldn't be one if the job market wasn't this terrible. <br />
        Fortunately, your parents have granted you a sizable fortune to live off. <br />
        This fortune also paid for your 2 masters degrees in social work and fine art. Which might explain your job situation. <br />
        <br />
        <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>
        The objective of this game is to be the richest thief by the time you retire. <br />
        The range of years the game lasts is set by the room creator. <br />
        The actual number of years the game lasts is a random number within that range. <br />
        <br />
        <h3>HEIST OCCURRENCE</h3>
        Every year, you will take part in a heist. <br />
        For everyone's security, your heist mates are chosen by an arbitrary third party. <br />
        Each heist consists of 2 or more thieves (including you). <br />
        The reward for a heist increases the larger it is (i.e. more thieves equals more money per person). <br />
        In the lobby of every heist, you can see the amount of years each fellow thief has spent in jail, and their approximate networth. <br />
        <br />
        <h3>GOING ON HEISTS</h3>
        You will be given a choice of whether or not to take part in the heist. <br />
        If half (rounded up) or more of the thieves in the heist choose to take part, the heist will occur. <br />
        The total reward is always the same. So the fewer thieves who take part, the larger the reward per thief. <br />
        If more than half of the thieves don't show up, the heist does not happen. <br />
        Regardless of whether the heist happens, all the thiefs that opt to take part will know of each other. <br />
        Note that you can uncheck the box to not go on the heist.
        <br />
        <h3>SNITCHING</h3>
        You can also opt to snitch on the thieves in the same heist as you. <br />
        If you snitch on them, and the heist happens, then every single thief that went on the heist goes to jail, and you get reward money. <br />
        Snitching on a heist also means that the heist does not dish out any reward. <br />
        If you snitch on them, and the heist doesn't happen, you get put in jail and fined. <br />
        If multiple thieves snitch, the reward money is split between them. <br />
        Note that you can snitch on a heist you take part in. <br />
        Also note if you snitch on a heist, even if you don't go on it, you can still be blackmailed! <br />
        Lastly, note that you can uncheck every box and go on no heists, nor snitch, that year. <br />
        <br />
        <h3>GOING TO JAIL</h3>
        Your jail sentence is a random number between your minimum and maximum jail terms. <br />
        Going to jail will always increase your next jail sentence. <br />
        Going to jail also makes you lose a portion of your money. <br />
        Unless you went to jail because you reported on your own crime, in which case you don't lose money. And are only sentenced the minimum amount. <br />
        <br />
        <h3>COMMITTING BLACKMAIL</h3>
        You can also opt to blackmail a thief in the same heist as you. <br />
        This option makes you go on the heist. <br />
        If the other thief does not show up for the heist and does not snitch, then you can't blackmail him. <br />
        In the event that the other thief has snitched on an earlier heist, or is snitching on the current heist, you blackmail him. <br />
        A thief that is blackmailed, if he chooses to snitch, will not successfully snitch. <br />
        Successfully blackmailing another thief will give you a large portion of his fortune. <br />
        However, if you try to blackmail a thief who has never snitched on a heist that occurred, you get thrown into jail. <br />
        If you're already in jail, your jail term will be extended. <br />
        Note that if the Snitch Blackmail Window is set to -1, that means that the window is permanent. <br />
        If multiple players successfully black a thief at the same time, the blackmail reward is split evenly. <br />
        <br />
        <h3>SPECIAL CONDITIONS</h3>
        Blackmailing happens before snitching - so if you blackmail someone who is snitching on that current round, that snitch fails. <br />
        If multiple people blackmail each other, blackmail money tranfers happen simultaneously. <br />
        Even if you have nothing to do, you have to click the 'OKAY' button for events to continue. <br />
