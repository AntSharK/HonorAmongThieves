About 1 screen down, there's a section that says **PRE-REQUISUTES**. Along with a link to download each of these pre-requisites.

Windows users should use ***Visual Studio*** or ***Visual Studio Code***. Using ***Visual Studio for Mac*** on a Windows machine is for advanced users or people who believe they can transcend the limits of their operating system.

## First-time setup
* Open ***/HonorAmongstThieves.sln*** with ***Visual Studio***.
* Pray that it's able to load

## General Debugging Tips
* If you find a problem, verify that it was there before. It's probably your fault.
* If it's not your fault, it might be a feature.
* It could also be a framework problem.
* It's definitely not my fault.

## FAQ
### Why did you choose SignalR?
Because it was the first thing that came up when I Googled "ASP.NET Core Async framework".


### Why did you choose ASP.NET Core?
Because it's related to things I already know.


### Why does the the UI look ugly?
Because I'm not going to learn UI design. Ever.

If you're reading this at a point in time where the UI does not look ugly, then at some point someone nice contributed to the UI. It definitely was not the original author.
